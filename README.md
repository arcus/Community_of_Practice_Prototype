# Welcome to the DART Community of Practice (Prototype)
This is a prototype for the Community of Practice repository that the DART program will use for discussions starting in wave 2.

This repository will hold the data and any related code for the Community of Practice Data Challenges, but its primary purpose is for DART participants to build a "Community of Practice" through the repository's [Discussions](https://github.com/arcus/Community_of_Practice_Prototype/discussions).

## Proposed cadence

Every week will have at least one new post, with data challenges spread out throughout the 16 weeks at 3-4 week intervals and social posts interspersed between. To start off there may be both social posts and data challenges, but they will become "either/or" later in the program.

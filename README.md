# Welcome to the DART Community of Practice (Prototype)
This is a prototype for the Community of Practice repository that the DART program will use for discussions starting in wave 2.

This repository will hold the data and any related code for the Community of Practice Data Challenges, but its primary purpose is for DART participants to build a "Community of Practice" through the repository's [Discussions](https://github.com/arcus/Community_of_Practice_Prototype/discussions).

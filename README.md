# Welcome to the DART Community of Practice (Prototype)
This is a prototype for the Community of Practice repository that the DART program will use for discussions starting in wave 2.

This repository will hold the data and any related code for the Community of Practice Data Challenges, but its primary purpose is for DART participants to build a "Community of Practice" through the repository's [Discussions](https://github.com/arcus/Community_of_Practice_Prototype/discussions).

## Proposed cadence


This cadence was discussed upon by the team members in a meeting on June 29, 2023. See the lists in each section for what we decided to do.

### Weekly

#### Social Discussion
Every week a new social prompt will be posted. It would be great if at some point throughout the week, each member of the DART team could engage with the social prompt to try to seed more interaction among participants. These are intended to be silly and quick, in the vein of "what is your favorite form of deep-fried data?"
- If possible, use GitHub Actions to schedule these weekly discussions.
- Move prompts from [future_posts](social_prompts/future_posts.md) to [used_posts](social_prompts/used_posts.md) as they are posted or scheduled.
- **Proposal for moderation and participation**
  - Each week day has a different team member responsible for posting their own social prompt response to seed conversation
  - Upvote/respond to posts by participants as appropriate
  - Monitor for bad behavior. If an inappropriate post is found, screenshot it, delete it, and confer with the rest of the team for next steps.

#### Office Hours
 Once a week we should have open, drop-in office hours, where people can ask us about modules, challenge problems, general data questions. There is a good chance that no one will come, or that people who do come will have questions we can't answer. In the case of module issues we can't answer, we should walk them through explaining the problem in a module feedback form. Our job is to be a slightly more sentient rubber duck, not an all-knowing oracle.
 - One office hour a week, staffed by a single team member. (More times and staffing for Week 1)
 - Move the timing around (change day of week and time of day).
 - Announce the time on the Announcements channel, but do not post the link. Tell people to check their email, and remove any posts containing the teams link from GitHub.
 - Create a sequence of weekly alerts in NALMS REDCap project with the links to these office hours.
 - Add mention of office hours and CoP to the weekly pathway progress emails participants receive


### Challenge Problems

Here is a proposed order of challenge problems:

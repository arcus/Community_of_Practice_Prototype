# Welcome to the DART Community of Practice (Prototype)
This is a prototype for the Community of Practice repository that the DART program will use for discussions starting in wave 2.

This repository will hold the data and any related code for the Community of Practice Data Challenges, but its primary purpose is for DART participants to build a "Community of Practice" through the repository's [Discussions](https://github.com/arcus/Community_of_Practice_Prototype/discussions).

## Proposed cadence


PLEASE GIVE FEEDBACK ON THIS PLAN

Every week will have at least one new post, with data challenges spread out throughout the 16 weeks at ~3 week intervals and social posts interspersed between. To start off there may be both social posts and data challenges, but they will become "either/or" later in the program.

### Weekly

**Social Discussion**: Every week a new social prompt will be posted. It would be great if at some point throughout the week, each member of the DART team could engage with the social prompt to try to seed more interaction among participants. These are intended to be silly and quick, in the vein of "what is your favorite form of deep-fried data?"

**Office Hours**: Once a week we should have open, drop-in office hours, where people can ask us about modules, challenge problems, general data questions. There is a good chance that no one will come, or that people who do come will have questions we can't answer. In the case of module issues we can't answer, we should walk them through explaining the problem in a module feedback form. Our job is to be a slightly more sentient rubber duck, not an all-knowing oracle.

### Challenge Problems

Here is a proposed order of challenge problems:
| Week | Challenge Problem | Problem status |
|:-:| :- | :-|
|1| Fair and Reusable Data | ready |
|4| Explore GitHub | ready |
|7| Open Data | ready |
|10| Rubber Ducking | outlined |
|13| Mystery File | ready |
|15| CV and Networking| outlined |

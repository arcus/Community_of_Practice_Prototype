| **Week 09:** Version Control Part 1: The Problem of Version Control | Read the article [Excuse me, do you have a moment to talk about version control?](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) by Jenny Bryan. While there may be some sections that don’t apply to you directly (for example if you don’t use R), the overall message is extremely important. | Share the "best" bad file name you have come across (or perhaps used yourself). These might be files like <ul> <li> probably_important3.doc, </li> <li> final_submission_actually_final.pdf, </li> <li> Untitled3523.jpg, etc. </li> </ul>| How do you keep track of changes in your files over time? What works well, and what problems have you encountered?|
| **Week 10:** Version Control Part 2: Introduction to GitHub | If you don’t already have one, create a GitHub account at [github.com](http://www.github.com). This can be a place for you to put some of your public work as part of your public portfolio. | What is the silliest/weirdest/best user name you have had or seen that you are willing to share? (Keep it work-appropriate, please.)| Share your GitHub handle with other members of your community of practice. If you have a pre-existing account, tell your community about what you have been using it for, but we expect that most of them will be empty because you just created them this week.|
| **Week 11:** Version Control Part 3: Open Source Projects | A project is **open source** if all of the code and files used to make it are publicly available and are free from most intellectual property restrictions. In other words, you can change and reuse open source code in your own project without getting special permission. There are a great many open source projects on GitHub, some maintained by large groups of collaborators. Use [GitHub’s search capabilities](https://github.com/search) - you can search by topic, author, or project name if you happen to know it - to find a repository that is interesting to you. Read its README file to learn more about it and explore the files it contains. | What is a technical term in your field that sounds like something different (or confusing or weird) to people outside of your subfield or community? For example GitHub users talk about "forking" a repository, which means making a copy of it that they can then use and modify however they like.| Share a link to the GitHub repository (or **repo**) you found interesting and give a little information about what it contains. Some questions to consider answering include, but are not limited to: <ul> <li> Does it have a license stating that it is open source? What restrictions does it have on its use? </li> <li> Does it have code you have used before, or are interested in using in the future? </li> <li> Does it have many maintainers, or just a couple (or one)? </li> <li> When was it last updated? Are people actively working on it? </li> </ul>|

## Open Data

While health data has strong privacy protections, other types of data are intentionally public. Many countries, states, territories, and municipalities have laws that require data to be publicly accessible. In this data challenge, you will find a public data set and explore it.

### Finding Open Data

Find an open data repository for your country, state / territory, or city by searching for "[region name] open data." Explore what datasets are available. Examples of open data repositories include: 
* Germany: <a href=https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/OpenData/_node.html>https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/OpenData/_node.html</a> 
* Manitoba: <a href=https://geoportal.gov.mb.ca/>https://geoportal.gov.mb.ca/</a> 
* New York City: <a href=https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/>https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/</a> 

There are also over 50,000 public datasets on the website [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com).

Public data repositories might contain many different data sets relating to things like population, public transportation, taxes, civil service jobs, utilities, etc. Pick a data set that interests you to use for the rest of this challenge.


### Explore Your Dataset

Now that you have chosen a data set, it is time to do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to figure out what it contains.

#### Explore the Metadata
Metadata is data about a dataset. First read this article about [what metadata is and why it is important](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/writing-metadata), and then see if you can figure out:
* The column or variable names 
* The total number of records 
* The type of data: is it numerical? Geographical? Human language? A mix of several types? 
* If there is missing data, and if so, how much?
* Who maintains this dataset? How frequently is it updated?

#### Explore the Data


Try to create a visualization of some of the data in your dataset from last week. While not everyone had R or Python in their pathway through the modules, if you did, try to create your visualization using one of those. You will most likely get error messages as you attempt to create a visualization. When you get an error message, share your error message with the group and see if anyone else got stuck at a similar spot.

| **Week 12:** Working with Data Part 1: Locating Public Data | Find an open data repository for your country, state / territory, or city. Search for "[region name] open data." Explore what datasets are available. Examples of open data repositories include: <ul> <li> Germany: <a href=https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/OpenData/_node.html>https://www.destatis.de/EN/Service/OpenData/_node.html</a> </li> <li> Manitoba: <a href=https://geoportal.gov.mb.ca/>https://geoportal.gov.mb.ca/</a> </li> <li> New York City: <a href=https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/>https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/</a> </li> </ul> | Share a data visualization you have particularly enjoyed. It might be from a news article, scientific journal, really anywhere as long as it is public. Or share a bad data visualization and explain why it is so bad. Many examples are available at https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/. | Share a dataset you encountered in this week’s activity. Where and how did you find it? What makes it particularly interesting or useful to you? Is there anything you are excited to do with this dataset in the future?| **Explore Further:** Search for interesting public datasets on [kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com), a site with over 50,000 public datasets.
| **Week 13:** Working with Data Part 2: Exploring Data | Explore a public data set. You can use yours or someone else's from last week or find a new one, just don't use one from your own research that needs to be kept private because we are asking you to share it. See if you can figure out: <ol> <li> The column or variable names </li> <li> The total number of records </li> <li> The type of data: is it numerical? Geographical? Human language? A mix of several types? </li> <li> If there is missing data, and if so, how much? </li> </ol> | Share a story of missing or wrong data. It could be something minor, or a major problem like the California man who got the [license plate NULL ](https://www.wired.com/story/null-license-plate-landed-one-hacker-ticket-hell/) for his car.| Share what you learned about your dataset. What programs, languages, or tools did you use to explore it? Did you get stuck at any point? Were you able to figure out if there was missing data?| **Explore Further:** The questions we asked in this week’s activity are examples of metadata. Read this short article about [what metadata is and why it is important](https://data.research.cornell.edu/content/writing-metadata).
| **Week 14:** Working with Data Part 3: Visualizing Data | Try to create a visualization of some of the data in your dataset from last week. While not everyone had R or Python in their pathway through the modules, if you did, try to create your visualization using one of those. You will most likely get error messages as you attempt to create a visualization. When you get an error message, share your error message with the group and see if anyone else got stuck at a similar spot. | What have you used in the past to create data visualizations? Are those visualizations easy to make and update? Do they look good and convey information effectively?| If you are able to create a visualization without encountering any error messages or difficulty running code, post your visualization and code and respond to others' posts about where they got stuck. What was challenging about creating, or attempting to create, your visualization?| **Explore Further:** Different members of your community of practice probably created their visualizations using different programming languages. No programming language is inherently better or worse than any other.

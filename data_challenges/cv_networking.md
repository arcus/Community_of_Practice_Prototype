# Self Promotion Challenge

It can be super hard to communicate what you know and how you have grown. That is why the last challenge of the DART program is specifically to get you to 
* update your CV/resume, 
* update any networking profiles you have (e.g. LinkedIn)
* update your employers and colleagues about your new skills!
